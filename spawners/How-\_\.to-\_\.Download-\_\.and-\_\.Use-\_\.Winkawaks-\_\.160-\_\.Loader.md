In this article, we will show you how to download and use Winkawaks 1.60 Loader to play your favorite arcade games on your PC.
 
## Step 1: Download Winkawaks 1.60 Loader
 
You can download Winkawaks 1.60 Loader from the official website of Winkawaks Team: [https://www.winkawaks.org/downloads.htm](https://www.winkawaks.org/downloads.htm). There are three files you need to download: WinKawaks.zip, kaillera.zip, and WinKawaks-FULL.zip. The first file contains the emulator itself, the second file contains the kaillera client for online play, and the third file contains both files in one package.
 
After downloading the files, extract them to a folder of your choice. You can place them anywhere you like, but we recommend creating a folder named "Winkawaks" in your C drive for convenience.
 
## Step 2: Run Winkawaks
 
To run Winkawaks, double-click on the Winkawaks.exe file in the folder where you extracted the files. You will see a window like this:

The first time you run Winkawaks, it will ask you to scan for ROMs. ROMs are files that contain the data of arcade games. You need to have ROMs of the games you want to play in order to use Winkawaks. You can find ROMs online from various sources, but be careful of legal issues and viruses.
 
Winkawaks supports two types of ROMs: ZIP and RAR. You can place your ROMs in any folder you like, but we recommend creating a subfolder named "roms" in your Winkawaks folder for organization. You can also create subfolders for different systems, such as "cps1", "cps2", and "neogeo".
 
After placing your ROMs in the appropriate folders, click on "OK" to scan for ROMs. Winkawaks will detect the ROMs and display them in the left panel of the window. You can sort them by name, system, or parent/clone.
 
## Step 3: Play Games
 
To play a game, simply select it from the left panel and click on "Load Game" or press F3. The game will load and run in a new window. You can adjust the settings of the emulator by clicking on "File", "Video", "Sound", or "Misc". You can also access the service mode button by pressing F11.
 
To play online with other players, you need to use the kaillera client. To do this, click on "NetPlay" and then "Client". A new window will open where you can choose a server and join a game or create your own. You can chat with other players by pressing T.
 
To exit a game or the emulator, press ESC.
 
## Conclusion
 
Winkawaks 1.60 Loader is a great emulator for arcade enthusiasts who want to enjoy classic games from Capcom and SNK systems on their PC. It has some advantages over the official Winkawaks, such as support for decrypted M ROMs, service mode button, and compatibility with other emulators. It is easy to download and use, and it also supports online play with kaillera client.
